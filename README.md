# dtmf-controlled-landmine-detection-rover

A simple dtmf contolled landmine detection rover
I have used DTMF Module based on MT8870 IC works perfectly.
An arduino based metal detector has been created here the circuit diagram is in the repository for reference. Replace the inductor (1mH)
shown in the circuit with a copper coil.

Use a keypad phone for best and consistent results.
