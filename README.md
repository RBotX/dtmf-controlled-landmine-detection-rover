# dtmf-controlled-landmine-detection-rover

A simple dtmf contolled landmine detection rover
I have used DTMF Module based on MT8870 IC works perfectly.
An arduino based metal detector has been created here the circuit diagram is in the repository for reference.

Use a keypad phone for best and consistent results.
